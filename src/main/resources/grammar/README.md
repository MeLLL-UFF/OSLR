The input parser used in this software was generated by Java Compiler Compiler (Version 7.0.2).

The knowledge_grammar.jj file have the grammar with respect to the knowledge base and theory input
(In fact, both can be mixed).

The example_grammar.jj file have the grammar with respect to the probLogExamples input.

To rebuild the parser call the JavaCC program for the knowledge_grammar.jj (example_grammar.jj) file inside the 
br.ufrj.cos.logic.parser.knowledge (br.ufrj.cos.logic.parser.example) package.

/*
 * Online Structure Learner by Revision (OSLR) is an online relational
 * learning algorithm that can handle continuous, open-ended
 * streams of relational examples as they arrive. We employ
 * techniques from theory revision to take advantage of the already
 * acquired knowledge as a starting point, find where it should be
 * modified to cope with the new examples, and automatically update it.
 * We rely on the Hoeffding's bound statistical theory to decide if the
 * model must in fact be updated accordingly to the new examples.
 * The system is built upon ProPPR statistical relational language to
 * describe the induced models, aiming at contemplating the uncertainty
 * inherent to real data.

     * We want to do g regularization updates simultaneously, as if they had been applied in previous gradients.
     * <p>
     * A single full regularization update is:
     * theta_f' = theta_f - learningRate * (2 * mu * theta_f )
     * = theta_f * (1 - 2 * mu * learningRate)
     * <p>
     * We can apply multiple updates by subbing theta' for theta, raising the multiplication factor to a power.
     * In this way, g updates produce:
     * theta_f' = theta_f * (1 - 2 * mu * learningRate) ^ g
     * <p>
     * We want to pose the update as an increment, so we can use our threadsafe update method.
     * <p>
     * theta_f' = theta_f + theta_f * (1 - 2 * mu * learningRate) ^ g - theta_f
     * = theta_f + theta_f * [(1 - 2 * mu * learningRate) ^ g - 1]

     * theta_f * [(1 - 2 * mu * learningRate) ^ g - 1]

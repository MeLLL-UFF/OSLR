/*
 * Online Structure Learner by Revision (OSLR) is an online relational
 * learning algorithm that can handle continuous, open-ended
 * streams of relational examples as they arrive. We employ
 * techniques from theory revision to take advantage of the already
 * acquired knowledge as a starting point, find where it should be
 * modified to cope with the new examples, and automatically update it.
 * We rely on the Hoeffding's bound statistical theory to decide if the
 * model must in fact be updated accordingly to the new examples.
 * The system is built upon ProPPR statistical relational language to
 * describe the induced models, aiming at contemplating the uncertainty
 * inherent to real data.

/**
 * A simple programmable procedure to determine if a feature is fixed
 * (i.e., the weight will not be changed in training) or not.  The
 * procedure is specified by a single string, which is a
 * colon-separated list of pairs SPEC[=DECISION] where SPEC is any
 * string (ending in * to specify a prefix) and DECISION is 'y' or 'n'
 * (default y).
 * <p>
 * To decide whether a particular feature S is of fixed weight, you go
 * through the rules, and take the DECISION associated with the first
 * spec that matches S.
 * <p>
 * <p>
 * For example:
 * <p>
 * "fixedWeight=y:*=n" means tune all features that aren't "fixedWeight".
 * <p>
 * "f(*=n:*=y" means tune only features that start with "f("
 * <p>
 * If no spec matches then the decision return is false.

    <option name="notice" value="Online Structure Learner by Revision (OSLR) is an online relational &#10;learning algorithm that can handle continuous, open-ended &#10;streams of relational examples as they arrive. We employ &#10;techniques from theory revision to take advantage of the already &#10;acquired knowledge as a starting point, find where it should be &#10;modified to cope with the new examples, and automatically update it. &#10;We rely on the Hoeffding's bound statistical theory to decide if the &#10;model must in fact be updated accordingly to the new examples.&#10;The system is built upon ProPPR statistical relational language to &#10;describe the induced models, aiming at contemplating the uncertainty &#10;inherent to real data.&#10;&#10;Copyright (C) 2017-&amp;#36;today.year &amp;#36;username&#10;&#10;This program is free software: you can redistribute it and/or modify&#10;it under the terms of the GNU General Public License as published by&#10;the Free Software Foundation, either version 3 of the License, or&#10;(at your option) any later version.&#10;&#10;This program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,&#10;but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of&#10;MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.

<!--
  ~ Online Structure Learner by Revision (OSLR) is an online relational
  ~ learning algorithm that can handle continuous, open-ended
  ~ streams of relational examples as they arrive. We employ
  ~ techniques from theory revision to take advantage of the already
  ~ acquired knowledge as a starting point, find where it should be
  ~ modified to cope with the new examples, and automatically update it.
  ~ We rely on the Hoeffding's bound statistical theory to decide if the
  ~ model must in fact be updated accordingly to the new examples.
  ~ The system is built upon ProPPR statistical relational language to
  ~ describe the induced models, aiming at contemplating the uncertainty
  ~ inherent to real data.

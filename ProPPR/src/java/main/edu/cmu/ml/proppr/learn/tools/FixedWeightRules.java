/** A simple programmable procedure to determine if a feature is fixed
(i.e., the weight will not be changed in training) or not.  The
procedure is specified by a single string, which is a
colon-separated list of pairs SPEC[=DECISION] where SPEC is any
string (ending in * to specify a prefix) and DECISION is 'y' or 'n' 
(default y).  

To decide whether a particular feature S is of fixed weight, you go 
through the rules, and take the DECISION associated with the first 
spec that matches S.


For example: 

"fixedWeight=y:*=n" means tune all features that aren't "fixedWeight".

"f(*=n:*=y" means tune only features that start with "f("

If no spec matches then the decision return is false.
